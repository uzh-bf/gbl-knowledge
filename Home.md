Welcome to our [[Game-Based Learning]] knowledge base. Our knowledge base contains the know how and best practices we have accumulated while developing games and simulations for our own teaching.

For a short guide on how this networked knowledge base works, see [[Getting Started]]. To get an overview of the games and simulations we have developed, see [[GBL @ DBF]].
