**Definition:** Gamification is a process in which game design elements are used in non-game contexts ([[Ref -> Deterding et al. (2011)]]), aiming to augment or alter an existing learning process to create a revised version of this process that users experience as game-like ([[Ref -> Landers et al. (2018)]]).

[[Game-Based Learning]] is one of the most important subcategories of [[Gamification]], and the one we work in with most of our projects.
