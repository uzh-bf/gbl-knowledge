[[Simulations]] are somewhat realistic representation of a real-world phenomenon. They often contain considerable amounts of data processing and mathematical computations. Such computations can be abstracted into [[Models]]. [[Models]] can interact and yield a game state, a representation of the game at a given point in time.

## Periods
In our [[Simulations]], there are almost always multiple periods in a single game. The simulation is played by the participants during a period, their decisions arecollected once a period is closing, and a new game state is computed by running the relevant [[Models]]. The new game state can then be shown to the
