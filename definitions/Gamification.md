## What is Gamification?

![[Gamification Circle.png]]

Gamification refers to the concept of applying game design elements in non-game contexts ([[Deterding et al. (2011)]]). Thereby, the gamification use-case is not limited to specific topics but can be utilized in a wide spectrum of area like business, health, marketing, and learning. Furthermore, gamification elements can range from being trivial like a reward system to leaderboards for tasks, but can also comprise complex simulations and serious games.

## Gamification in Learning
In our projects, we aim to augment or alter existing learning processes to create a revised version of this process that users experience as game-like ([[Landers et al. (2018)]]). Therefore, in our project we mainly focus on the gamification subcategory of Game-Based Learning, where Simulations and Serious Games play an important role. Furthermore, we apply gamification to [[Microlearning]].

## Why is Gamification helpful?
Gamification can solve the problem of motivation in learning because it increases the userâ€™s learning engagement ([[Prensk (2001)]]). Moreover, gamified (micro-)content is more captivating as it stimulates curiosity and exploration as well as captures the structured play of rules and the competitive pursuit of goals ([[Deterding et al. (2011)]]). Other benefits of gamification are improved learning outcomes ([[Mekler et al. (2017)]]),  increased knowledge retention, and enhanced collaboration and teamwork.

When working with Gamification principles, we regularly refer to the [[Octalysis Framework]] as a baseline of the different elements that make up the overall topic.
