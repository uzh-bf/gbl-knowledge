## What is Gamification?

Gamification is a process in which game design elements are used in non-game contexts ([[Deterding et al. (2011)]]), aiming to augment or alter an existing learning process to create a revised version of this process that users experience as game-like ([[Landers et al. (2018)]]).

[[Game-Based Learning]] is one of the most important subcategories of [[Gamification]], and the one we work in with many of our projects.

When working with [[Gamification]] principles, we regularly refer to the [[Octalysis Framework]] as a baseline of the different elements that make up the overall topic.
