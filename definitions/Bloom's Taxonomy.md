The Bloom Taxonomy is a taxonomy of educational objectives. It serves as a framework to classify statements about the expected learning as a result of instructions. The taxonomy is depicted as a hierarchy of six major categories of the cognitive process. The categories differ in their complexity with increasing complexity the higher the category is rated.

## Remember
In the "Remember" category, the focus lies on identifying and retrieving of relevant knowledge from memory and on the retention of learned materials. Its associated cognitive processes are "Recognizing" and "Recalling".
- **Recognizing** refers to identifying knowledge and locating it in one's memory.
- **Recalling** is the process of retrieving knowledge from memory.


## Understand
The "Understand" category refers to determining the meaning of instructional messages and communication of all sorts (oral, written and graphic). The following cognitive processes are related to "Understand":
- **Interpreting** is connotated with clarifying, paraphrasing, representing, or translating some communication. It is applied when changing from one form of representation to another like paraphrasing a speech.
- **Exemplifying** 
- **Classifying**
- **Summarizing**
- **Inferring**
- **Comparing** 
- **Explaining** refers to the construction of a model of a system for example a model to describe causes and their effects.

The categorization is not strict and overlapping is possible.

The Bloom Taxonomy is also applicaple to [[Microlearning]].
