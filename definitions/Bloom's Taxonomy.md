The Bloom Taxonomy is a taxonomy of educational objectives. It serves as a framework to classify statements about the expected learning as a result of instructions. The taxonomy is depicted as a hierarchy of six major categories of the cognitive process. The categories differ in their complexity with increasing complexity the higher the category is rated.
