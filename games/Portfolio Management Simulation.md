In the Portfolio Management Game you and your team take on the role as a manager of a bank’s portfolio management and compete with different teams. Based on a computer-assisted simulation, the entire investment process is simulated from the perspective of an asset manager using historical or fictitiously generated business cycles.

You will be assigned client types for whom you select suitable asset management mandates based on their respective needs. In a next step you formulate the investment strategy of the client's portfolios and work out both a strategic and tactical investment strategy. The latter is based on forecasts of the business cycle, which you receive at the beginning of every investment period. Subsequently, the strategy will be implemented. You have to choose between active and passive management as well as a top-down or bottom-up approach and select the individual securities. The performance is measured and evaluated periodically. Decisions are made on the bank’s business factors such as conditions & fees, human resources, logistics and profit distribution.
