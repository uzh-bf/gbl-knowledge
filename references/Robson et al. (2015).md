## Paper's Abstract
There is growing interest in how gamification - defined as the application
of game design principles in non-gaming contexts - can be used in business. However,
academic research and management practice have paid little attention to the
challenges of how best to design, implement, manage, and optimize gamification
strategies. To advance understanding of gamification, this article defines what it is
and explains how it prompts managers to think about business practices in new and
innovative ways. Drawing upon the game design literature, we present a framework of
three gamification principles - mechanics, dynamics, and emotions (MDE - to explain
how gamified experiences can be created. We then provide an extended illustration of
gamification and conclude with ideas for future research and application opportunities.
