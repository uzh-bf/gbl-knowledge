**Definition:** (Digital) Game-Based Learning describes „any marriage of educational content and computer games“ ([[Ref: Prensky (2007, p. 145)]]). As such, the game becomes the training. Important game types are: Serious Game and Simulation.

## Why is Game-Based Learning useful?
- **Experience as main driver for learning**: According to learning scientists experience is an important factor of learning: “If you do it, you learn it”. This can be obtained by applying serious games and simulations ([[Ref: Mayo (2007)]]).

- **Immediate feedback**: Serious games and simulations provide players with current feedback on their actions. They allow players to test different behaviour and strategies and experience possible implications ([[Ref: Christen and Katsarov (2018)]]).

- **Learning effects**: Numerous meta-analyses show superior learning outcomes when learning with serious games and simulations compared to traditional learning techniques ([[Ref: Sailer and Homner (2020)]]).

- **Safe environment**: Serious games and simulations enable a risk-free learning environment. This allows for players to make mistakes and to derive valuable learning experiences from these ([[Ref: Fox, Pittaway, and Uzuegbunam (2018)]]).

## How does Game-Based Learning work?
Effects paths of Serious Games and Simulations ([[Ref: Mayer (2011)]]; [[Ref: Wouters et al. (2013)]]):
-   **Cognitive path**: Enhanced cognitive activation and versatile approach to learning content
-   **Motivational path**: Promotion of intrinsic motivation, leading to longer and more intensive engagement with learning content
    
Effects ([[Ref: Mayer (2011)]]; [[Ref: Wouters et al. (2013)]]):
-   **Cognitive effects**: Increased acquisition of declarative and procedural knowledge
-   **Motivational effects**: Increased interest and target focus, experience of one's own competences, satisfaction of motivational needs
