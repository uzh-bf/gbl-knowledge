**Status**: In Progress

We feel that [[Game-Based Learning]] is not as well-known as it should. With the GBL Community, we want to establish a place for exchange between lecturers at our university (and possibly others). With regular interactions, such a community could be fostered and ultimately increase the use of [[Game-Based Learning]].

## Communities

While we want to build a community consisting of lecturers at UZH, there are many existing communities in the Game-Based Learning landscape.
