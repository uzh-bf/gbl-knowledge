We feel that [[Game-Based Learning]] is not as well-known as it should. With the GBL Community, we want to establish a place for exchange between lecturers at our university (and possibly others). With regular interactions, such a community could be fostered and ultimately increase the use and knowledge of [[Game-Based Learning]].

## The GBL@UZH Community
Our GBL Community is primarily focused on lecturers at the University of Zurich. Therefore, our community is hosted on the Microsoft Teams platform of our university. However, it is also possible to join as an external guest. If that should not work, please contact us. 

To join, simply use the public link of our teams channel:
